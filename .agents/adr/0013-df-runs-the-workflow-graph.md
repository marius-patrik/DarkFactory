# ADR-0013 — df runs the workflow graph

**Status**: Accepted

**Related rules**: `DF-RULE-010`, `DF-RULE-011`, `DF-RULE-012`, `DF-RULE-013`, `DF-RULE-014`, `DF-RULE-018`

## Decision

DarkFactory executes delivery as a declarative graph of agent, gate, automation and check-reference nodes with explicit edges and loop semantics.

Planning, implementation, review/fix, alignment and deterministic effects are orchestrated by the graph/runtime. Static CI checks may remain external and are observed through check-reference nodes.

Execution is serializable per durable run identity. Concurrent ingress for the same run cannot execute the same transition concurrently or overwrite a newer persisted transition. External effects are separately serialized by deterministic effect identity and reconciled after ambiguous interruption.

## Consequences

Execution state is durable and resumable. Workflow topology has one declarative source rather than duplicated script orchestration, and duplicate/out-of-order ingress cannot create duplicate logical mutations.
